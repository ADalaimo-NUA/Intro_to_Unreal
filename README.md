# Intro to Unreal 

## Slides accompanying workshops will be located on the VLE, on the Programming and coding page. 

Each branch will accompany that week's dedicated slide deck. With the Main branch being updated throughout to have all project code reflected together. 

### Start of Workshop

If you would like to download each workshop files seperately, navigate to the according *branch* and download the zipped file of those project files. 
Project files will contain all BPs with commented code to reflect what was represented during the session. 

Add to these files to make it your own! 
OR, scrape the things you like fom these to add to your own projects and make them better!

Best,
Andy
